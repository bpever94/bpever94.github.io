## Portfolio
#### This portfolio provides a comprehensive view of my abilities to combine the principles of Industrial Engineering and  Data Science techniques to design, analyze, and optimize systems, delivering valuable insights and interesting outcomes.
#### The projects presented use Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Sklearn. My main objective was to create Data Science projects relevant to my field of expertise.
